# Authentication and Sync Operations

This runbook defines the live Phase 2 behavior for Plaud Mirror.

## Auth Mode

### Current Mode: Manual Bearer Token

- Operator pastes a Plaud bearer token in the web UI.
- API validates it against Plaud before storing it.
- Token is encrypted at rest in `data/secrets.enc`.
- If Plaud later rejects the token, the service moves into a degraded auth state and requires operator action.

### Later Mode: Automatic Re-login

Automatic re-login remains a roadmap item only. It is not part of the current deployment contract.

## Auth State

The service exposes:

- whether a token is configured
- current auth state: `missing`, `healthy`, `degraded`, or `invalid`
- resolved Plaud API base when known
- last successful validation timestamp
- last auth error

## Sync Behavior

### Phase 2

- Sync is operator-triggered only.
- Backfill is operator-triggered only.
- Supported filters (backend schema `SyncFiltersSchema`):
  - date range (`from`, `to`) — surfaced in the web UI.
  - `serialNumber` — surfaced in the web UI as a device selector fed by `/api/devices`.
  - `scene` — accepted for programmatic callers only; the web UI no longer exposes it because the raw integer values are opaque to operators (see CHANGELOG 0.4.12).
- Existing mirrored recordings are skipped unless `forceDownload` is requested.
- Webhook delivery is attempted immediately after mirroring.
- Delivery attempts are persisted even when the webhook call fails.

### Phase 3

The following are explicitly later:

- scheduler-driven polling
- retry queue/outbox behavior
- resumable backfill

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Current response | Operator action |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| Missing token | UI shows `missing` auth state | Paste and validate a token |
| Invalid token | UI/API show `invalid` or `degraded` state | Replace token |
| Plaud download failure | Request fails, sync summary records failure | Re-run after checking logs or upstream drift |
| Webhook delivery failure | Attempt stored as failed, mirrored file kept locally | Fix webhook target/secret and re-run |

## Security Rules

- Never log bearer tokens or webhook secrets.
- Never log full Plaud temp URLs.
- `PLAUD_MIRROR_MASTER_KEY` is mandatory for runtime startup.

## Operational Signals

The UI and `/api/health` should make it obvious:

- whether auth is usable
- whether webhook configuration is complete
- when the last sync ran
- how many recordings are already mirrored
