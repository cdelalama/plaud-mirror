# Project Context - Plaud Mirror

## Vision

Build a self-hosted Plaud mirror that gets the original audio artifact out of Plaud and into local infrastructure with low operator friction.

## Objectives

- Persist mirrored audio locally in a predictable layout.
- Offer a small web panel for auth, visibility, and manual control.
- Deliver a generic webhook that downstream systems can consume.
- Keep auth and download behavior auditable in-repo.
- Track upstream changes that can break or improve the Plaud path.

## Architectural Summary

Plaud Mirror is a server-first product with two runtime surfaces:

- `apps/api/`: Fastify API plus same-process worker logic
- `apps/web/`: React/Vite operator panel served by the API runtime

Persistence is split between SQLite for state/indexes and the filesystem for mirrored audio artifacts. Secrets are encrypted at rest with a master key supplied by the surrounding deployment.

## Current Status (2026-04-24)

Plaud Mirror `v0.4.17` is the extended Phase 2 slice: the original manual vertical slice plus local-only curation, UX polish, Mode B sync semantics, classic pagination, stable `#N` sequence numbers, async sync with live-progress polling, a cached device catalog that backs a real `<select>` in the backfill form, and a backfill dry-run preview that shows the operator exactly which recordings a click would download (with per-row state badges) before committing. `POST /api/sync/run` returns 202 immediately and the panel polls `/api/health` every 2 s to surface `downloaded X of Y` as the run advances. The repository now has:

- a live Fastify API
- a web panel for token setup, webhook configuration, sync/backfill controls, and recordings visibility
- encrypted persisted manual bearer-token auth
- manual sync and filtered historical backfill (async: 202-then-poll, with a `limit=0` "refresh server stats" path)
- SQLite-backed recording and delivery state (including `dismissed`/`dismissed_at` columns for local curation)
- immediate HMAC-signed webhook delivery with persisted attempt logging
- inline audio playback per recording, with a confirmed local-only dismiss/restore flow that never touches Plaud
- Docker packaging for `dev-vm`, running as non-root `USER 1000:1000`
- the original Phase 1 spike CLI for direct Plaud probing

What it still does not have:

- continuous scheduler-driven sync
- resumable backfill
- automatic retry outbox for webhook delivery
- automatic re-login
- NAS validation

## Phase Boundaries

The roadmap is normative. See [docs/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

Short version:

1. Phase 1 proved the Plaud path.
2. Phase 2 ships the first manual usable product slice.
3. Phase 3 adds unattended operation and resilience.
4. Phase 4 revisits automatic re-login.
5. Phase 5 hardens deployment and validates NAS.
6. Phase 6 prepares public OSS fit and finish.
